Examples of JSON schemas used to generate GUIs.

Match mxcubecore after PR #794 (commit bf4fcee), mxcubeqt after PR #453 (commit 025edca),
and mxcubecore Wiki entry"JSON-schema generated user interface".
The Wiki entry contains context, explanation,
and the UI panels generated by the json files here shown.

The files match the UI snapshots shown in the Wiki. For each panel there is the json
that was used to generate it (e.g. Acquisition.json) and the parameters returned on
pressing Commit (e.g. Acquisition.return.json).

The files update_indexing.json, update_lattice.json and update_spacegroup.json
show the parameters sent to the UI after updating indexing, lattice and spacegroup
respectively in the PreAcquisition popup. update_transmission.json shows the
parameters sent to the UI after changing trnsmission (and changing the colour coding on
the dose budget fields).
